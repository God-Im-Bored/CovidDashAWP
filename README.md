Technologies
    #Python
        - general purpose programming language that is high-level, easy to learn and dynamically initialized 
        - open source language so it is free for anyone to use
        - can be used to make almost any type of applications
    #Numpy
        - mainly used to create/handle multi-dimensional arrays and large arrays for scientific computing
        - provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with 'ndarray' easier
    #Pandas
        - 'Python Data Analysis Library'
        - open source library built on top of numpy that is used for data analysis
        - takes data (like a CSV file) and creates a Python object with rows and columns called 'data frame' that looks similar to a table
    #ipywidgets(interact)
        - a widget is an 'eventful python object'
        - resides in the browser and is a UI elements (slider, textbox, etc.)
        - 'interact' function automatically creates UI controls for exploring code and data interactively
    #Plotly (express, graph_objects)
        - library that provides online graphing, analytics, and statistics tools for data analysis
        - supports over 40 unique chart types ranging from: statistical, to financial, to geographical
    #Folium
        - library used for visualizing geospatial data
    #Voila
        - turns Jupyter notebooks into standalone web applications
        - from Jupyter's ecosystem --> can share/deploy work as interactive web apps(i.e., dashboard)
